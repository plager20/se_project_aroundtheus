Around The U.S.

This is a project for Triple Ten that is tasked to create a social media page for Jacques Cousteau. This site is primarily for adding photos where other users can view and like these photos.

The site should be responsive allowing users to view the site on multiple devices including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

In this project, I ulitilized the grid mechanic in order to get the visual that was desired.
